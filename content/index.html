        <h2>Meet Our Pastor</h2>
        <p>
          Pastor Micah A. Ernst was born August 17, 1957 to August and Mildred Ernst, in Buffalo, Minnesota. He is the
          fourth child of seven; two sisters and 4 brothers. He attended Salem Lutheran Christian Day School at Loretto,
          Minnesota, to the 4th grade and finished his education at the public schools in Buffalo, Minnesota.
          <br><br>
          After high school he worked in construction for 5 years. On June 24th, 1979, Micah and Claudia, his high school
          sweetheart, were united in Holy Matrimony. Claudia, a graduate of Dr. Martin Luther College of New Ulm,
          Minnesota, taught school at Trinity Lutheran, Belle Plaine, Minnesota. Through much heartfelt prodding, the
          Lord truly directed Micah to continue his education to study for the pastoral ministry.
