        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Micah Ernst, Pastor of Grace Lutheran Church, and I'd like to personally welcome you to the
          part of God's family that meets at Grace Lutheran Church.
          <br><br>
          If you are looking for a church home or are in need of a word from our Lord Jesus, we'd love to speak with you
          and get to know you. We know you'll feel at home in our house of worship and fellowship with other believers
          during Sunday morning worship, Bible Enrichment, or either of our mid-week Bible studies.
          <br><br>
          Have questions, or just want to visit? Check our Contact section, or call our church office at 573-474-8755.
